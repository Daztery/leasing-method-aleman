# Final-Project-Finance
This is the final project for the Finance course. Done with Django (super fast)

To run this project, you will need to have installed python 3.6.5 at least, as well as a command line like Anaconda Prompt in order to run the server.
You can run the website with the following command: python manage.py runserver.
Enjoy!
